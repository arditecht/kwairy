## DEV SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Make sure you have VSCode with Dev-Containers available.
2. Go to the lower-left corner button and go to "New Dev Container" in the prompted list.
3. Scroll a bit down and select a "simple Debian" image and create the container.
4. Once devcontainer workspace opens up in VSCode, Open its terminal ( ctrl + ` ) and run the following:
	- `sudo apt update`
	- `sudo apt -y upgrade`
	- `python3 --version` check the Python Version [17-08-2023: The default 3.9.x that you get with this should work fine for now.]
5. Download pip3 by `sudo apt install -y python3-pip`.
6. Do `pip3 install numpy` to check if it is working.
7. There are few more subtle dependencies that run the dev setup better overall.
	- To install the extra deps., run `sudo apt install build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev python3-dev`
8. Git comes preinstalled in Debian, so just run git clone [url of this repo] in a folder you want as the project root.
9. Make sure you're in the created project root folder at this point.
6. To install the full set of python libraries needed for this application, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
7. Before running this app on your browser, you need to add a `.env` file to this project/repository root folder. Open the `.env` file,
	- add `OPENAI_API_KEY = <your-openai-key>`
